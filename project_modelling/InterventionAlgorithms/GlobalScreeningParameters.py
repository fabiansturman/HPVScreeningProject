 #NOTE: and the initial screening (i.e. the only thing not a followup) is modelled as a repeated probability again and again - so if it is not an annual probability it works out not quite right.

#TODO: all the changed I have made for NHS_2025_lambdamu.py need to also go into the other screening policy file (maybe recopy and remake the latter from the updated former?)

Derivation of the above: 
event has prob p. We want, in a sequence of n attempts of teh event, to have the event happen at least once with prob gamma.

P(at least 1 occurance in n trials) = 1-P(no occurance in n trials)
                                    = 1 - (1-p)^n
                                    = gamma

Therefore,
    (1-p)^n = 1-gamma
    1-p = (1-gamma)^(1/n)
    p=1-(1-gamma)^(1/n)

    #NOTE on the interpretation of these probabilities: in their raw (hardcoded) form above, they represent the probability of a person offered a particular intervention taking it up at all. When processed (as any which need processing are done by here in the file), they represent year-wise probabiolities of an agnet taking up a particular reccomended treatment - the probabolity mass is not equally distributed across the year, however, as HPVsim can't know in advance how many times an agent will be offered a particular treatment in a given year, so instead each agent has ONE chance per year to get the treatment (even if reccomended it on several timesteps that year), which is the first time taht year, and then thier next chance at getting the treatment isd the first offering of the treatment next year.
        #^ this is how I understand the probabilities to work, given when I change abandon_followup_invites_threshold without changing its floor, nothing changes - while if I take away the 'floor' functions from my formalae and change, say, 1 to 0.99, it all goes out of whack
         #TODO: confirm the above with Robyn,but I am pretty confident this is correct and therefore i can move on in the meantime!
