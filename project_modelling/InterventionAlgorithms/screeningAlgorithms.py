"""
This file contains an model of the current NHS England Cervical Screening Algorithm, with adjustments to allow for changing regular screening callback intervals to differ between three subpopulations of women:
    -> Vaccinated individuals (women offered at least one dose of some HPV vaccine)
    -> Unvaccinated, vaccine-eligible, individuals (women with no doses of a HPV vaccine but who were eligible for routine vaccination aged 12-13)
    -> Vaccine-ineligible individuals (women who were aged over 12 in 2008)

The algorithm switches from the current NHS England Cervical Screening Algorithm to the amended one at the switch year (2026).
