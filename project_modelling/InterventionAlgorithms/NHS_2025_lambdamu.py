This file contains an model of the current NHS England Cervical Screening Algorithm, with adjustments to allow for changing regular screening callback intervals to differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
The algorithm switches from the current NHS England Cervical Screening Algorithm to the amended one at the switch year (2026).
