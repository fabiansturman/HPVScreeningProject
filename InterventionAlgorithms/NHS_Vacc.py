This file contains an model of the NHS England vaccination strategy(ies) since 2008.

File usage:
    -> Import this file to easily integrate vaccination model into a HPVsim simulation
    -> Run this file (as __main__) to run a HPVsim simulation with this screening and debug changes to the algorithm

Notable modelling assumptions:
    -> HIV is not being modelled in this study, justified by low HIV prevalence in the UK, particularly among those with cervixes. Therefore, we do not include branches of the pathway which relate to HIV, assuming all individuals are HIV -ve.

Below are sources to justify modelling decisions.


Compliance:
    -> Covergae of (complete; one dose) vaccination of females by year in UK (2010-2021): (78,83,87,84,85,84,83,82,82, 82,64,59); (86,89,91,90,90,88,86,86,85, 85,60,77)

    -> Coverage of (complete; one dose) vaccination of males by year in UK (2020-2021): (-, 48); (53,71)

2008-2011: starting vaccination
    Bivalent Cervarix vaccine to 12-13 year old girls, 3 doses

    + 2008-2010: catch-up campaign
            Targeting girls aged 14-18 years with Bivalent Cervarix vaccine, 3 doses

2012-2013: switch to 4vHPV
    Quadrivalent Gardasil vaccine to 12-13 year old girls, 3 doses

2014-2018: down to 2 doses
    Quadrivalent Gardasil vaccine to 12-13 year old girls, 2 doses

2019-2021: adding boys
    Quadrivalent Gardasil vaccine to 12-13 year old girls+boys, 2 doses

2022-2022: switch to 9vHPV
    Nonavalent Gardasil-9 vaccine to 12-13 year old girls+boys, 2 doses

2023-: down to 1 dose
    Nonavalent Gardasil-9 vaccine to 12-13 year old girls+boys, 1 dose

Modelling several doses:
    -> We have data on (A)#1-dose vaccinatons, (B)#completed vaccine courses
    -> Therefore, model all people who are 'vaccinated' (that is, have at least one dose) as elibile for further courses,
    -> ... where prob of second dose is p(full course|1 dose) and we model p(3rd dose|2nd dose)=1 (iff 3rd dose being offered) (rather than, say, a linear dropoff between probs, all people who go for a second dose also get a 3rd, if applicable)

Modelling girls and boys:
    -> right now, I am averaging girl and boy participation data and doing the vaccination regieme to both at the same time for years where there is sex-neutral vaccination. However, as boys have consistently lower vaccine uptake than girls, I suppose I could improve this!    

Modelling beyond 2021:
    -> Assuming 90% first dose coverage, and 80% second dose coverage in 2022. TODO: get vaccination uptake for 22,23,24 and then get a better assumption for coverage! Of course, will do a notable sensitivity analysis here too!
